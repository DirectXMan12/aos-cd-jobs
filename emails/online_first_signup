A new Sprint is beginning and the Continuous Delivery team may need to reach out to a member of your team to analyze issues during our cluster upgrades.

Selected team members should be aware of this assignment and must be able to prioritize these requests above typical Sprint development.

Please update the support contact spreadsheet [1] for this Sprint and Continuous Delivery will reach out to the identified resource directly when the need arises.

The team member specified in the spreadsheet:
    - Should join the following IRC channel for the duration of the Sprint: #aos-devops .
    - Should contact jupierce with any concerns or questions.
    - Will automatically be subscribed to the aos-cicd-devops [2] mailing list in the coming days.
      Communications about upgrades will be shared through this mailing list.
    - Can capture their thoughts on the upgrades here [3].
